LFMC
================

## Introduction

Package **LFMC** is designed to assist the creation, management, and
analysis of the live fuel moisture content (LFMC) database of the
*Servei de Prevenció d’Incendis Forestals* (SPIF) of the Catalan
administration. The database is the outcome of a biweekly monitoring of
five Mediterranean plant species in nine catalonian study sites since
1998.

## Package installation

You can download and install the latest stable versions of the R package
from GitHub as follows (required package `devtools` should be
installed/updated first):

``` r
devtools::install_github("vegmod/LFMC")
```
